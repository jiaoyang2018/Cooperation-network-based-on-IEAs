# Cooperation-network-based-on-IEAs

These are the codes for the implementation of the construction and analysis of the international environmental cooperation network based on International Environmental Agreements (IEAs), as described in our paper:

Carattini, Stefano, Sam Fankhauser, Jianjian Gao, Caterina Gennaioli, and Pietro Panzarasa. What does network analysis teach us about international environmental cooperation? Ecological Economics. 2022.  arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.08883. (Accepted)

## Codes

Network construction and analysis are conducted by Python, while the regression analysis in the paper is performed using Stata.

## How to use the code
import  weighted_network as wn

import dataset_construction as dc

import appendix as ap
